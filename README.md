This is the README.md file for the Module 2 Challenge given by the University of Texas Coding Bootcamp.

# description
* As a developer, I want to create a website that showcases the work I have successfully completed while I was a student at the University of Texas Coding Bootcamp. 

# acceptance criteria
* GIVEN I need to sample a potential employee's previous work:
 * WHEN I load their portfolio
    * THEN I am presented with the developer's name, a recent photo or avatar, and links to sections about them, their work, and how to contact them
 * WHEN I click one of the links in the navigation
    * THEN the UI scrolls to the corresponding section
 * WHEN I click on the link to the section about their work
    * THEN the UI scrolls to a section with titled images of the developer's applications
 * WHEN I am presented with the developer's first application
    * THEN that application's image should be larger in size than the others
 * WHEN I click on the images of the applications
    * THEN I am taken to that deployed application
 * WHEN I resize the page or view the site on various screens and devices
    * THEN I am presented with a responsive layout that adapts to my viewport
